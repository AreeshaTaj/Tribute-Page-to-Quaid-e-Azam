    <font size="30">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;M</font>uhammad Ali Jinnah (Urdu pronunciation: [moɦəmːəd̪ əliː d͡ʒɪnːɑːɦ],
    Gujarati pronunciation: [məɦ(ə)məd̪ əli d͡ʒʱiɽ̃ɑ]; born Mahomedali Jinnahbhai; 25 December 1876 – 11 September
    1948) was a barrister, politician, and the founder of Pakistan. Jinnah served as the leader of the All-India
    Muslim League from 1913 until the inception of Pakistan on 14 August 1947, and then as the Dominion of Pakistan's
    first governor-general until his death. Born at Wazir Mansion in Karachi, Jinnah was trained as a barrister at
    Lincoln's Inn in London. Upon his return to India, he enrolled at the Bombay High Court, and took an interest in
    national politics, which eventually replaced his legal practice. Jinnah rose to prominence in the Indian National
    Congress in the first two decades of the 20th century. In these early years of his political career, Jinnah
    advocated Hindu–Muslim unity, helping to shape the 1916 Lucknow Pact between the Congress and the All-India Muslim
    League, in which Jinnah had also become prominent. Jinnah became a key leader in the All-India Home Rule League,
    and proposed a fourteen-point constitutional reform plan to safeguard the political rights of Muslims in the
    Indian subcontinent. In 1920, however, Jinnah resigned from the Congress when it agreed to follow a campaign of
    satyagraha, which he regarded as political anarchy.
  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By 1940, Jinnah had come to believe that the Muslims of the
    subcontinent should have their own state to avoid the
    possible marginalised status they may gain in an independent Hindu–
    Muslim state. In that year, the Muslim League, led by Jinnah, passed the Lahore Resolution, demanding a separate
    nation for Indian Muslims. During the Second World War, the Muslim League gained strength while leaders of the
    Congress were imprisoned, and in the provincial elections held shortly after the war, it won most of the seats
    reserved for Muslims. Ultimately, the Congress and the Muslim League could not reach a power-sharing formula that
    would allow the entirety of British India to be united as a single state following independence, leading all parties
    to agree instead to the independence of a predominantly Hindu India, and for a Muslim-majority state of Pakistan.
  </p>
  <p>As the first governor-general of Pakistan, Jinnah worked to establish the new nation's government and policies, and
    to aid the millions of Muslim migrants who had emigrated from neighbouring India after the partition in August 1947,
    personally supervising the establishment of refugee camps. Jinnah died a year after Pakistan's creation and was
    buried at Mazar-e-Quaid. He is revered in Pakistan as the Baba-e-Qaum ("Father of the Nation") and Quaid-e-Azam
    ("Great Leader"). His birthday is observed as a national holiday in Pakistan.</p>
